# About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Yuekun Yao (Ella), a second-year student at the University of Auckland, majoring in Business Analysis, Statistics, and Computer Science. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and drive innovation in business.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring various technologies and their applications in different domains. From data analytics to machine learning and cloud computing, I enjoy delving into new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set and broaden my understanding of the digital landscape.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m delving into AWS Cloud and preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test to deepen my expertise.
- ðŸ˜„ Outside of tech, I find joy in hiking and cycling, which offer both relaxation and inspiration.
- ðŸ“š As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking opportunities to grow through courses, workshops, and projects.

Let's code, learn, and explore together! ðŸš€
